# SIB SPARQL examples

We collect the SPARQL examples in different formats,
for different projects of the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics where we
have a public SPARQL endpoint.

In this github pages we have a HTML rendering for all them.

 * [Language Coverage](./examples/LanguageCov/)
 * [Ontology Overlap](./examples/Ontoverlap)
 * [Ontology Total](./examples/Totamount)
 * [UniProt](./examples/UniProt/)

We also collect [some basic statistics on the different SPARQL features in use](./examples/algebra-statistics.md)
